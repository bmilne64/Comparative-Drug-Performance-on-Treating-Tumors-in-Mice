The notebook contains three observations or insights about the data

There was a fairly equal distribution of male and female mice utilized in the study.The sample population was 50.74% male and 49.26% female. 

The line graph shows that as time progresses, Mouse x401's' tumor volume  decreases due to the Capomulin treatment. This indicates that the Capomulin treatment could be a viable treatment option for the tumors if this same result occurs in other mcie also treated with Capomulin/a larger sample size. 

Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest vaiance and standard deviation, indicating that these drugs could be the most reliable forms of treatment for the tumors.
